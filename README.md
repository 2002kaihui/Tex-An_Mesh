# Tex-An Mesh: Textured and animatable human body mesh reconstruction from a single image

We provide a method that will surely excite every Potterhead on the planet. As we all remember, the people in the photos hanging on the fictional wall of Hogwarts freely move around and even jump into other frames to visit. Our method helps to make the magic a reality, so we can make a person in a 2-D photo perform various motions.

**Figure 1**: Given a single photo as input (far left), we create a 3D animated version of the subject, which can now walk towards the viewer (middle).
